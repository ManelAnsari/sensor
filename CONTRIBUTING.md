Above table shows the development Entities, their stages and where you can contribute.

- Each Entity (Feature or Sensors/Actuator) has 8 stages which goes from Request to Tutorial.
- Each Entity gets a new Issue.
- Each Issue gets tagged with the ongoing stage `Tag`.
- You can come in at any stage and help contribute to the project.


## Pull Request Process
TBD, contact yogesh@iotiot.in if you want to know more details.
