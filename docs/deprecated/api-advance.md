## Advance Mode API's

Advance mode is for people who are perfectionists and expect the same 
from Shunya Interfaces. 

It allows the users to tweak and change each setting according to their 
preferences.


>But, I am not an Advance User, well we just have the perfect thing for you. Try out [Simple Mode](api-simple.md).
